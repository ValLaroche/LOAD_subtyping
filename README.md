# LOAD_Subtyping

## Background
Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is the most common form of dementia, typically developing after the age of 65. It primarily affects memory, cognitive function, and behavior. This condition is characterized by the gradual accumulation of amyloid-beta (AÎ²) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain, resulting in the progressive destruction of neurons and brain atrophy. However, significant heterogeneity has been observed among individuals with LOAD in terms of disease onset, progression, symptom variability, spreading of pathology, and their response to treatment. In recent years, molecular subtyping of AD has increasingly leveraged omics data to discover distinct molecular profiles that may underlie the observed heterogeneity in disease manifestation and mechanisms. This has been particularly transformative as traditional classification methods based on clinical or pathological features alone have proven insufficient. 

## Methods
In the present study, we used genome-wide DNAm data from three independent postmortem brain cohorts to identify epigenomic-based subtypes of LOAD. We employed data-driven methods to identify molecular subtypes of LOAD individuals based on the highest degree of similarity in methylomic patterns within each cohort. The subtypes were further validated through rigorous cross-cohort comparisons using multiple clustering algorithms. To better understand the complex biological mechanisms underlying the observed heterogeneity, we conducted a comprehensive characterization of predicted subtypes at cell-type-specific DNAm levels. Additionally, we examined AD risk genes as potential contributors to the methylomic heterogeneity and identified transcriptomic correlates for each subtype using both bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data.
