# LOAD_Subtyping

## Background
Growing evidence suggests that the heterogeneity of late-onset Alzheimerâ€™s disease (LOAD) plays a significant role in treatment failure. This study identifies two distinct epigenetic subtypes of LOAD using genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) data from three independent postmortem brain cohorts (n = 831 samples). Data-driven clustering revealed reproducible LOAD subtypes characterized by cell-type-specific DNAm profiles. 

## Methods
In the present study, we used genome-wide DNAm data from three independent postmortem brain cohorts to identify epigenomic-based subtypes of LOAD. We employed data-driven methods to identify molecular subtypes of LOAD individuals based on the highest degree of similarity in methylomic patterns within each cohort. The subtypes were further validated through rigorous cross-cohort comparisons using multiple clustering algorithms. To better understand the complex biological mechanisms underlying the observed heterogeneity, we conducted a comprehensive characterization of predicted subtypes at cell-type-specific DNAm levels. Additionally, we examined AD risk genes as potential contributors to the methylomic heterogeneity and identified transcriptomic correlates for each subtype using both bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data.
